The best hospitals have been decided on the basis of the aggregation of scores from the Timely and Effective Care data and Readmission and Death data. Some measures were removed from this set as they did not make sense to the variable description in the data dictionary. These measures were 'OP_21', 'OP_20', 'OP_18b','OP_3b','OP_1','ED_2b', and 'ED_1b'. Some of these variables were a measure of time while others a measure of volume. The data dictionary describes the 'score' variable in this file to be a percentage of patients.

Some variables were also converted from "lower score better" to a "higher score better" by taking their difference from a 100. This allowed us to take the avg of the scores and treat them "the higher the better" scale. Measures to which this transformation was appllied included all measures from the Readmission and Death dataset and the 'OP_22' measure from the Timely and Effective Care dataset.

We believe this to be an accurate measure of the quality of care at hospitals because it takes into account a number of different measures that are applicable to different scores. The data has been treated to make it useful without compromising the detail or the granularity. We also believe that by taking the average of scores we account for the variety of treatments offered at a facility. So a hospital does not have a greater score simply because it offers more treatments. Every procedure in a hospital is accorded the same weight to make this analysis unbiased to the different sizes of facilities. 

Keeping this in mind we find that the following hospitals have the highest aggregate scores and thus have the highest quality of care:
