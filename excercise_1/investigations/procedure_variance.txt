i To annswre this particular question, data from three files was used, Timely and Effective Care-Hospital, Readmission and Death-Hospital, and measure dates. The scores were treated and cleaned in the same way as the best hospitals questiosn. The var_samp() function was used from the Hive Language Manual. We believe that this is the best way to compute teh variances between different hospitals for a given measure besure because the scores are taken from a number a of different hospitals across the country and the patients are randomly selected for each measure. It lowers the possibilty of any kind of bias and allows us to get a good account of the variance in measures for a given procedure across different hospitals.

Using this method we find the following procedures to have the greatest variances:
