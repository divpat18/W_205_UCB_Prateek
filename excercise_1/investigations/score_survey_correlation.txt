Data was used from three files for this particular question. These were Timely and Effective Care-Hospital, Readmission and Death-Hospital and HVBP_HCAHPS_05_28_2015 files. The "Overall rating Achievement", "Overall rating Improvement", and the "Overall rating Dimensional" were all used for computing the correlation with the score values from the effective care and readmission tables. The corr(x,y) function from the Hive Language Manual was used for calculating the Pearsons R. We believe that these variables cover all aspects of a hospital holistically and therefore are viable candidates for measuring this correlation with the measure score. Using this method we found that for all score the three variables the correlation was very small. The R values were:

Overall Achievement	Overall Improvement 	Overall Dimensional
0.26021950869435123 	0.1319746104431992 	0.24104321773368784

We found that all the three had a very samll correlation with score.
